- name: Visual Intelligence Agents (VIA) 
  website: http://robots.kmi.open.ac.uk/ 
  img: /images/HanS.jpg
  desc: My research is currently focused on enhancing the Visual Intelligence of service robots by combining 
Knowledge-driven technologies with Machine Learning. Specifically, I am working on a prototype of robot assistant which
can monitor office environments in search for potentially dangerous situations (e.g., flammable items left by ignition sources, 
cluttered emergency exits, dangling cables, and others). <br>

  desc: While studying at the Pennsylvania State University, I have been a part of the Human Screenome Project, 
a collaboration with the Departments of Communication and Medicine at Stanford University. In the Screenomics Lab, 
I have developed an end-to-end solution to automatically extract the textual content of digitaL screenshots collected from laptop and smartphone devices,
while also providing a customised search engine indexing to navigate the extracted contents. <br>
